This problem describes the many-to-many relationship.
To build this relationship, we create in the database a link table, containing two columns: CategoryId, ProductId,
which are foreign keys.

The first one, CategoryId, refers to the "Category" table.
The second one, ProductId, refers to the "Product" table.

To solve the task, you need to execute this query:
   SELECT p.[Name] AS 'ProductName', 
          ISNULL(c.[Name], 'Missing') AS 'CategoryName'
     FROM Product p
LEFT JOIN CategoryProduct cp
          ON p.Id = cp.ProductId
LEFT JOIN Category c
          ON cp.CategoryId = c.Id
